### Student Management System Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of a Student Management System, including its architecture, components, and functionalities.

#### Architecture

The Student Management System follows a structured architecture consisting of the following components:

1. **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and orchestrate the interaction between the user interface and the backend services. Controllers are responsible for validating input, invoking service methods, and returning appropriate responses.

2. **Services**: Contain the business logic of the application. Services encapsulate complex operations such as creating, retrieving, and deleting student records. They interact with the database through Eloquent models and enforce business rules.

3. **Views**: Render the user interface using the Vue.js framework with Vuetify components. Views present student data in a structured and visually appealing manner, enabling users to interact with the system seamlessly.

4. **Routes**: Define the endpoints and corresponding controller methods for handling various HTTP requests. Routes map incoming requests to the appropriate controller actions, enabling the execution of specific functionalities.

5. **Database**: Stores student records using the Laravel Eloquent ORM. The database schema includes a `students` table with fields for `id`, `username`, `email`, and `timestamps`.

#### Functionality

The Student Management System offers the following functionalities:

1. **Create Student**: Users can add new student records by providing the student's username and email address through a form. Upon submission, the system validates the input and stores the new student record in the database.

2. **View Students**: Users can view a paginated list of existing student records. The system retrieves student data from the database and displays it in a tabular format using Vuetify DataTable components. Pagination controls allow users to navigate through multiple pages of student records.

3. **Delete Student**: Users can delete individual student records by clicking the "Delete" button next to each student entry in the list. The system prompts users for confirmation before deleting the selected student record. Upon confirmation, the system removes the student record from the database.

#### Service Layer

The StudentService handles interactions with student data in the database. It provides the following methods:

- **getAllStudents**: Retrieves a paginated list of all student records from the database.
- **createStudent**: Creates a new student record in the database based on the provided data. Laravel request validation ensures that the input meets specified rules before creating the record.
- **deleteStudent**: Deletes a student record from the database based on the student's ID.

#### Laravel Request Validation

Laravel request validation ensures that data submitted to the application meets specified rules before processing. In the Student Management System, validation rules are defined in the `CreateStudentRequest` class. These rules enforce constraints such as required fields, maximum lengths, and unique email addresses.

#### Test Cases

The Student Management System includes unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of its functionalities. Test cases cover the following scenarios:

1. **Store Student**: Verifies that creating a new student record correctly invokes the `createStudent` method in the service layer and redirects the user to the student index page upon successful submission.

2. **Delete Student**: Verifies that deleting an existing student record correctly invokes the `deleteStudent` method in the service layer and redirects the user to the student index page after successful deletion.

#### Installation and Setup

To set up the Student Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install Composer dependencies using `composer install`.
3. Install NPM dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Configure the database connection in the `.env` file.
5. Run database migrations using `php artisan migrate`.
6. Start the Laravel development server using `php artisan serve`.
7. Access the application in your web browser.

#### Usage

Once the application is set up and running, users can perform the following actions:

- Navigate to the student index page to view existing student records.
- Click the "Save" button to create a new student record.
- Enter the student's username and email address in the form and submit it.
- Delete student records by clicking the "Delete" button next to each student entry.
